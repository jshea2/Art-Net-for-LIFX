      - Generate New Token
- Click "Connect LIFX" button
   - This will open the "DevTools" window and if connected will log all available scenes on the account.
   - If you do not see this make sure it's on the **"Console"** tab, not "Elements"
   - You'll also notice a drop-down list of all available LIFX bulbs 
- Now to "Patch" these bulbs to our Art-Net universe
   - Select LIFX bulb from drop-down list and input starting "Address"
   - Click "Patch/Add LIFX Bulb" button
   - This will patch and also log below
      - You can also patch **more than one** bulb to the **same** address for grouping multiple LIFX bulbs to one patched fixture in your lighting software
- Input your Art-Net's "Subnet, Universe, and Net" ([0, 0, 0] is usually the default)
- Click "Start" and send some Art-Net!
   - The "Latency" Slider is for adjusting how fast it sends to the LIFX API, If you set it too low be aware LIFX commands might start freezing.

- Each LIFX Bulb is set up to be a 3-channel fixture (Red, Green, Blue)
   - You can use generic 3-channel RGB profiles to patch
   - *Fun Fact:* The Free version of QLab lets you do 16-channels, so you can control 5 LIFX fixtures separately

## Notes:
- Current workaround for "Clearing Patch" is to go to "View>Reload". This will reset everything, including re-inputting your Access Token.
- Other features not available, but currently in the works:
   - Deleting "Patched" Bulbs
